Student Management System

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Developed a RESTful web application using Spring Boot, implementing CRUD operations for managing student data through layered architecture (API, service, and data layers).

Integrated Spring Data JPA with a relational database to perform seamless data persistence and retrieval using entity mappings and repositories.

Configured the application using Spring Boot properties, implemented dependency injection to ensure modular and maintainable code.
